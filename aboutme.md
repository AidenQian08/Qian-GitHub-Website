# About Me

Hello! I’m **Aiden Qian**, a high school student deeply passionate about STEM—especially in fields like mathematics, computer science, and biology. I’m actively involved in **Science Olympiad** and various **math competitions**, where I love tackling complex problems and collaborating with my teammates. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate enough to earn **regional** and **state titles**, as well as a **top-10 national finish** with my Science Olympiad Codebusters Team.

In addition to academics, I’m dedicated to giving back to the community through **Qian Tennis Academy**, a nonprofit I co-founded to share the excitement of tennis with underrepresented youth. Coaching and mentoring students in tennis has taught me the importance of building strong, supportive communities. My love for tennis extends to competing, where I’ve enjoyed success in both individual and team events.

When I’m not competing or working on my studies, I love to unwind by **watching sports** and **Netflix**. Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue exploring my interests in STEM through higher education and research, with the goal of making meaningful contributions to science and technology while fostering inclusivity and collaboration in everything I do.

Feel free to connect with me if you'd like to learn more or collaborate!
